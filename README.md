# Decision Tree From Scratch

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a decision tree from scratch. The notebook is part of the Machine Learning Specialization course by Andrew Ng, specifically from the 2nd chapter.

## Contents
- `C2_W4_Decision_Tree_with_Markdown.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the decision tree implementation and exercises.
- `README.md`: Description of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Description
In this notebook, you will find:
- A refresher on decision trees.
- Exercises to calculate entropy, split datasets, calculate information gain, and get the best split.
- A step-by-step guide to building a decision tree from scratch.
- Application of the decision tree to classify whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/regmibhuwan/decision-tree-from-scratch.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
cd decision-tree-from-scratch

3. **Install the Dependencies**:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
jupyter notebook C2_W4_Decision_Tree_with_Markdown.ipynb

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project classifies mushrooms as edible or poisonous. Ensure you have the dataset in the appropriate format.
